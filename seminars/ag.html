            <li class="title">On wall crossing for K-stability with multiple boundaries</li>
            <li class="abstract">In this talk, we will focus on a wall-crossing theory for log Fano pairs with multiple boundaries. As a key ingredient, we will present that the K-semistable domains are polytopes. This is based on a recent work <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13503">arXiv:2302.13503</a>.</li>

            <li class="title">Numerical methods for working with polynomial systems</li>
            <li class="abstract">Whether testing conjectures in algebraic geometry or trying to solve polynomial systems for some application, numerical methods are sometimes a useful alternative to well-known symbolic algorithms. This talk is intended to introduce some of the main tools of the field of numerical algebraic geometry, including homotopy continuation and the numerical irreducible decomposition. In particular, given a polynomial system, we will see how numerical methods can provide floating point approximations to points on each irreducible component of the corresponding complex variety. We will also visit a few recent uses of these methods and consider the benefits and drawbacks compared to exact, symbolic methods.</li>

            <li class="title">A relative Yau&ndash;Tian&ndash;Donaldson conjecture and stability thresholds</li>
            <li class="abstract">On a Fano variety, the Yau&ndash;Tian&ndash;Donaldson correspondence connects the existence of K&auml;hler&ndash;Einstein metrics to an algebro-geometric notion called <i>K</i>-stability. In the last decade, the latter has proved to be very valuable in algebraic geometry: for instance, it is used for the construction of moduli spaces. In the first part of the talk, partly motivated by the study of K&auml;hler&ndash;Einstein metrics with prescribed singularities, a new relative <i>K</i>-stability notion will be introduced for a fixed smooth Fano variety. A particular focus will be given to motivations and intuitions, making a comparison with the log <i>K</i>-stability/log K&auml;hler&ndash;Einstein metrics. The relative <i>K</i>-stability and the K&auml;hler&ndash;Einstein metrics with prescribed singularities will then be related to each other through a Yau&ndash;Tian&ndash;Donaldson correspondence, which will be the core of the talk. An important role will be played by algebro-geometric valuative criteria, which will be also used to link the relative <i>K</i>-stability to the genuine <i>K</i>-stability.</li>

            <li class="title">The minimal projective bundle dimension and toric 2-Fano manifolds</li>
            <li class="abstract">In this talk we will discuss higher Fano manifolds, which are Fano manifolds with positive higher Chern characters. In particular we will focus on toric 2-Fano manifolds. Motivated by the problem of classifying toric 2-Fano manifolds, we will introduce a new invariant for smooth projective toric varieties, the minimal projective bundle dimension, <i>m(X)</i>. This invariant <i>m(X)</i> captures the minimal degree of a dominating family of rational curves on <i>X</i> or, equivalently, the minimal length of a centrally symmetric primitive relation for the fan of <i>X</i>. We'll present a classification of smooth projective toric varieties with <i>m(X) &ge; dim(X)-2</i>, and show that projective spaces are the only 2-Fano manifolds among smooth projective toric varieties with <i>m(X)</i> equal to <i>1</i>, <i>dim(X)-2</i>, <i>dim(X)-1</i>, or <i>dim(X)</i>. This is joint work with Carolina Araujo, Roya Beheshti, Ana-Maria Castravet, Svetlana Makarova, Enrica Mazzon, and Nivedita Viswanathan.</li>

            <li class="title"><i>K</i>-moduli space of del Pezzo surface pairs</li>
            <li class="abstract">A K3 surfaces with anti-symplectic involution can be identified with a pair <i>(X,C)</i> consisting of a del Pezzo surface <i>X</i> with a curve <i>C ~ −2K<sub>X</sub></i>. Their moduli space has many compactifications from various perspectives. In this talk, we will discuss the compactifications from <i>K</i>-moduli theoretic side and its relation to Baily&ndash;Borel compactification from Hodge theoretic side. In particular, we will give an explicit description of <i>K</i>-moduli space <i>P<sub>c</sub><sup>K</sup></i> parametrizing <i>K</i>-polystable del Pezzo pairs <i>(X,cC)</i> under the framework of wall-crossing for <i>K</i>-moduli space due to Ascher&ndash;DeVleming&ndash;Liu. Moreover, we will show the <i>K</i>-moduli space <i>P<sub>c</sub><sup>K</sup></i> is isomorphic to certain log canonical model on Baily&ndash;Borel compactification of the moduli space of K3 surfaces with anti-symplectic involution. This can be viewed as another example of Hassett&ndash;Keel&ndash;Looijenga program proposed by Laza&ndash;O'Grady. This is based on joint work with Long Pan and Haoyu Wu.</li>

        <li class="title">Pencils of plane cubics revisited</li>
        <li class="abstract">In recent joint work with M. Hattori we have considered the problem of classifying linear systems of hypersurfaces (of a fixed degree) in some projective space up to projective equivalence via geometric invariant theory (GIT). And we have obtained a complete and explicit stability criterion. In this talk I will explain how this criterion can be used to recover Miranda’s description of the GIT stability of pencils of plane cubics.</li>

        <li class="title">Reductive quotients of klt varieties</li>
        <li class="abstract">In this talk, I will explain the proof of a recent result, obtained together with Daniel Greb, Kevin Langlois, and Joaquin Moraga, that reductive quotients of klt type varieties are of klt type. This generalizes and extends a classical result by Boutot, stating that these kinds of quotients preserve rational singularities. The statement was also well known in the case of finite groups. If time permits, I will also discuss several applications of our result, e.g. on quotients of Fano type varieties, good moduli spaces, and collapsing of homogeneous bundles.</li>

        <li class="title">Automorphisms of weighted projective hypersurfaces</li>
        <li class="abstract">Automorphism groups of smooth hypersurfaces in projective space are well studied in algebraic geometry. In this talk, I'll work in the more general setting of automorphism groups of quasismooth hypersurfaces in weighted projective space and consider the following questions: when are these groups linear? When are they finite, and if finite, how large can they get? What does the automorphism group of a very general hypersurface with given weights and degree look like? In each case, I'll generalise analogous results for ordinary projective hypersurfaces and explain how unexpected behaviour appears in the weighted setting.</li>

        <li class="title">Reconstructing curves from their Hodge classes</li>
        <li class="abstract">Recently, Movasati and Sert&ouml;z pose several interesting questions about the reconstruction of a variety from its Hodge class. In particular they give the notion of a perfect class: the Hodge class of a variety <i>X</i> is perfect if its annihilator is a sum of ideals of varieties whose Hodge class is a nonzero rational multiple of that of <i>X</i>. I will report on a joint work with Gian Pietro Pirola and Enrico Schlensiger, in which we give an answer to some of these questions for curves: in particular, we show that the Hodge class of a smooth rational quartic on a surface of degree 4 is not perfect, and that the Hodge class of an arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay curve is always perfect. Moreover, I will give some results on the problem in higher dimension.</li>

        <li class="title">Toric degenerations of partial flag varieties via matching fields and combinatorial mutations</li>
        <li class="abstract">Toric degenerations are an important tool that can be used to analyze algebraic varieties as they allow us to understand a general variety via the geometry of their associated toric varieties. In this talk, I will show how to produce a new large family of toric degenerations of Grassmannians and (partial) flag varieties, whose combinatorics is governed by matching fields. Moreover, I will study the relations between polytopes associated to different toric degenerations of the same variety. This is done using the tool of combinatorial mutations, particular piecewise linear functions on polytopes. Finally, I will show how our methods can be used to compute new families of toric degenerations of small Grassmannians and flag varieties. This talk is based on joint work with Oliver Clarke and Fatemeh Mohammadi.</li>

        <li class="title">Toward the logarithmic Hilbert scheme</li>
        <li class="abstract">Logarithmic geometry provides tools to work relative a normal crossings divisor, including normal crossings degenerations. I will report on work in progress with Mattia Talpo and Richard Thomas to define a natural logarithmic analogue of the ordinary Hilbert scheme. Immediate applications include induced good degenerations of Hilbert schemes of points. Our point of view also suggests a definition of tropical Hilbert schemes. One larger aim is to develop robust logarithmic methods to deal with coherent sheaves in maximal degenerations as they appear in mirror symmetry.</li>

        <li class="abstract">We consider log Calabi&ndash;Yau pairs of the form <i>(</i><b>P</b><sup>3</sup><i>, D)</i>, where <i>D</i> is a quartic surface, up to volume-preserving equivalence. The coregularity of the pair <i>(</i><b>P</b><sup>3</sup><i>, D)</i> is a discrete volume-preserving invariant <i>c=0,1</i> or <i>2</i>, and which depends on the nature of the singularities of <i>D</i>. We classify all pairs <i>(</i><b>P</b><sup>3</sup><i>, D)</i> of coregularity <i>c=0</i> or <i>1</i> up to volume preserving equivalence. In particular, if <i>c=0</i> then we show that <i>(</i><b>P</b><sup>3</sup><i>, D)</i> admits a volume preserving birational map onto a toric pair.</li>

        <li class="title">Forbidden patterns in tropical planar curves and panoptigons</li>
        <li class="abstract">Tropical curves in <b>R</b><sup>2</sup> correspond to metric planar graphs but not all planar graphs arise in this way. We describe several new classes of graphs that cannot occur. For instance, this yields a full combinatorial characterization of the tropically planar graphs of genus at most six. We also define a special family of lattice polytopes namely panoptigons and enumerate all possible panoptigons under mild lattice width constraints and show how they can be used to find a forbidden pattern in tropical planar curves. We also will discuss some possible applications of the classification of panoptigons and ongoing work on suitable generalizations. This talk is based on work in Tewari (2022) and joint work with Michael Joswig (2020) and Ralph Morrison (2021).</li>

        <li class="title">A generalization of the Murnaghan-Nakayama rule for <i>K</i>-<i>k</i>-Schur and <i>k</i>-Schur functions</li>
        <li class="abstract">We introduce a generalization of <i>K</i>-<i>k</i>-Schur functions and <i>k</i>-Schur functions via the Pieri rule. Then we obtain the Murnaghan&ndash;Nakayama rule for the generalized functions. The rule are described explicitly in the cases of <i>K</i>-<i>k</i>-Schur functions and <i>k</i>-Schur functions, with concrete descriptions and algorithms for coefficients. Our work recovers the result of Bandlow, Schilling, and Zabrocki for <i>k</i>-Schur functions, and explains it as a degeneration of the rule for <i>K</i>-<i>k</i>-Schur functions. In particular, many other special cases promise to be detailed in the future.</li>

        <li class="title">Mirror symmetry for the parabolic <i>G</i>-Higgs bundle, from local to global</li>
        <li class="abstract">Motivated by geometric Langlands, we initiate a program to study the mirror symmetry for the moduli space of parabolic <i>G</i>-Higgs bundles. This talk will focus on <i>G=Sp<sub>2n</sub></i> and its Langlands dual <i>SO<sub>2n+1</sub></i>. Our goal is to prove the SYZ mirror symmetry and topological mirror symmetry (TMS). The parabolic structure of the parabolic Higgs bundle is related to the nilpotent orbit closure. So we need to first figure out the mirror pair for nilpotent orbits. Classically, there is a famous Springer duality between special orbits. Therefore, it is natural to speculate that the mirror symmetry we seek may coincide with Springer duality in the context of special orbits. Unfortunately, such a naive statement fails. To remedy the situation, together with Prof. Ruan and Prof. Fu (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.10533">arXiv:2207.10533</a>), we propose a conjecture which asserts the mirror symmetry for certain parabolic/induced covers of special orbits. Then, we prove the conjecture for Richardson orbits and obtain certain partial results in general. After understanding the mirror parabolic structures, together with W. He, X. Su, B. Wang, X. Wen, we are working in progress to prove the SYZ and TMS for the moduli space of parabolic <i>Sp<sub>2n</sub> / SO<sub>2n+1</sub></i>-Higgs bundles with dual parabolic structures.</li>

        <li class="title">Stability of toric vector bundles in terms of parliaments of polytopes</li>
        <li class="abstract">Given any toric vector bundle, we may construct its parliament of polytopes. This is a generalization of the Newton polytope (or moment polytope) of a toric line bundle. This object contains a huge amount of information about the original bundle: notably on its global sections and its positivity. We can also easily know if the toric bundle is (semi-/poly-)stable with respect to any polarisation. I will give a combinatorial visualisation of stability of toric vector bundles.</li>

        <li class="abstract">According to the Sarkisov Program, a birational map between a Fano variety of Picard rank one and a Mori fibre space can be decomposed as a finite sequence of Elementary Sarkisov Links starting with the blowup of a centre. Hence, it is natural to try to understand the latter maps explicitly. In this talk we explain how to describe all possible toric Elementary Sarkisov Links starting with the blowup of a point in <b>P</b><sup>4</sup>.</li>

        <li class="abstract">Given a bipartite graph <i>G</i> (subject to a constraint), the &quot;cross-ratio degree&quot; of <i>G</i> is a non-negative integer invariant of <i>G</i>, defined via a simple counting problem in algebraic geometry. I will discuss some natural contexts in which cross-ratio degrees arise. I will then present a perhaps-surprising upper bound on cross-ratio degrees in terms of counting perfect matchings. Finally, time permitting, I may discuss the tropical side of the story.</li>

        <li class="abstract">Semitoric systems are a type of four-dimensional integrable system which admit a global <i>S<sup>1</sup></i>-action; these systems were classified by Pelayo and Vu Ngoc in 2011, generalizing the classification of toric integrable systems and making use of an invariant called a &quot;semitoric polygon&quot;. I will present some results about bifurcations of such systems, and show how this can be used to construct explicit examples of such systems associated to certain given semitoric polygon. Time permitting, I will also discuss how hypersemitoric systems, a generalization of semitoric systems, appear in this context. Some of the results I will present are joint with Yohann Le Floch and Sonja Hohloch.</li>

        <li class="title">Birational maps of Severi-Brauer surfaces, with applications to Cremona groups of higher rank</li>
        <li class="abstract">Cremona groups are groups of birational transformations of a projective space. Their structure depends on the dimension and the field. In this talk, however, we will first focus on birational transformations of (non-trivial) Severi-Brauer surfaces, that is, surfaces that become isomorphic to the projective plane over the algebraic closure of <i>K</i>. Such surfaces do not contain any <i>K</i>-rational point. We will prove that if such a surface contains a point of degree 6, then its group of birational transformations is not generated by elements of finite order as it admits a surjective group homomorphism to the integers. As an application, we use this result to study Mori fiber spaces over the field of complex numbers, for which the generic fiber is a non-trivial Severi-Brauer surface. We prove that any group of cardinality at most the one of the complex numbers is a quotient of the Cremona group of rank 4 (and higher). This is joint work with J&eacute;r&eacute;my Blanc and Egor Yasinsky.</li>

        <li class="abstract">We will discuss an explicit graph formula, in terms of boundary strata classes, for the wall-crossing of universal (over the moduli space of curves) Brill-Noether classes. More precisely, fix two stability conditions for universal compactified Jacobians that are on different sides of a wall in the stability space. Then we can compare the two universal Brill-Noether classes on the two compactified Jacobians by pulling one of them back along the (rational) identity map. The calculation involves constructing a resolution by means of subsequent blow-ups. This is joint with Nicola Pagani.</li>

        <li class="abstract">In 1974 Tango proved that there are no non-constant morphisms from <b>P</b><sup>n</sup> to the Grassmannian <i>G(l,m)</i> if <i>n &gt; m</i>; similar results were later obtained for morphisms from other Fano manifolds to Grassmannians. In this talk I will present the following generalization of these results: if <i>X</i> and <i>Y</i> are rational homogeneous manifold obtained as quotients of classical groups <i>G<sub>X</sub></i> and <i>G<sub>Y</sub></i> of the same type and <i>rk(G<sub>X</sub>) &gt; rk(G<sub>Y</sub>)</i> then there are no non-constant morphisms from <i>X</i> to <i>Y</i>. The key ingredient of the proof is the determination of the <i>effective good divisibility</i> of rational homogeneous manifolds of classical type, that is, the greatest integer <i>s</i> such that two effective cycles in the Chow ring whose sum of codimensions is <i>s</i> have nonzero intersection.

        <li class="title">Scatter, cluster, scatter, model</li>
        <li class="abstract">Cluster algebras were invented/discovered in order to understand total positivity. But almost immediately, mathematicians (and later physicists) started finding connections between the combinatorics/geometry/algebra of cluster algebras and other areas of mathematics and physics. Most relevant for this talk are two connections: In one direction, the theory of scattering diagrams (mirror symmetry/Donaldson-Thomas theory/integrable systems) has been applied to prove key structural results about cluster algebras. In the other direction, certain cluster algebras seem to be relevant to the computation of scattering amplitudes in physics. The title of this talk is also an outline. I will introduce scattering diagrams, then introduce cluster algebras, and connect the two. Then I will give a brief, naïve summary of the observed connections between cluster algebras and scattering amplitudes, to motivate the idea that a physicist might be interested in combinatorial models for cluster algebras/scattering diagrams. I will conclude with a survey of the state of research on these combinatorial models, focusing on the models that I have worked most closely with.</li>

        <li class="abstract">I will explain a general procedure to construct Newton&ndash;Okounkov bodies for a certain class of (partial) compactifications of cluster varieties. This class consists of the (partial) minimal models of cluster varieties with enough theta functions. This construction applies for example to Grassmannians and Flag varieties, among others. Our construction depends on a choice of torus in the atlas of the cluster variety and the associated Newton&ndash;Okounkov body lives inside a real vector space. Time permitting, I will explain how to compare the Newton&ndash;Okounkov bodies associated with different tori and elaborate on the &quot;intrinsic Newton&ndash;Okounkov body&quot;, which is an object that does not depend on the choice of torus and lives inside the real tropicalization of the mirror cluster variety. This is based on upcoming work with Lara Bossinger, Man-Wai Cheung and Timothy Magee.</li>

        <li class="abstract">Calabi&ndash;Yau hypersurfaces in toric spaces of general type (encoded by certain non-convex polytopes) are degenerate but may be smoothed by rational anticanonical sections. Nevertheless, gauged linear sigma model phases and an increasing number of their classical and quantum data are just as computable as for their siblings encoded by reflexive polytopes, and they all have transposition mirrors. Showcasing Calabi&ndash;Yau hypersurfaces in Hirzebruch scrolls shows this class of constructions to be infinitely vast, yet amenable to several well-founded algebro-geometric  methods of analysis.

        <li class="abstract">Graph potentials are Laurent polynomials associated to (colored) trivalent graphs that were introduced in a joint work with Belmans and Galkin. They naturally appear as Newton polynomials of natural toric degenerations of the moduli space of rank two bundles. In this talk we will first discuss how graph potentials compute quantum periods of the moduli space <i>M</i> of rank two bundles with fixed odd degree determinant and hence can be regarded as a partial mirror to <i>M</i>. From the view point of mirror symmetry, we will show how the critical value decomposition of graph potentials provides evidence for the conjectural semiorthogonal decomposition of D<sup>b</sup>Coh(<i>M</i>). If time permits we will also discuss a formula to efficiently compute the periods of graph potential via a TQFT. This is a joint work with Pieter Belmans and Sergey Galkin. </li>

        <li class="abstract">Cluster varieties come in pairs: for any <i>X</i>-cluster variety there is an associated Fock&ndash;Goncharov dual <i>A</i>-cluster variety. On the other hand, in the context of mirror symmetry, associated with any log Calabi&ndash;Yau variety is its mirror dual, which can be constructed using the enumerative geometry of rational curves in the framework of the Gross&ndash;Siebert program. I will explain how to bridge the theory of cluster varieties with the algebro-geometric framework of Gross&ndash;Siebert mirror symmetry, and show that the mirror to the <i>X</i>-cluster variety is a degeneration of the Fock&ndash;Goncharov dual <i>A</i>-cluster variety. To do this, we investigate how the cluster scattering diagram of Gross&ndash;Hacking&ndash;Keel&ndash;Kontsevich compares with the canonical scattering diagram defined by Gross&ndash;Siebert to construct mirror duals in arbitrary dimensions.

        <li class="abstract">Let <i>X -&gt; D<sup>*</sup></i> be a maximal degeneration of <i>n</i>-dimensional Calabi&ndash;Yau varieties over the punctured disk. The SYZ conjecture, motivated by mirror symmetry, predicts that the general fiber <i>X<sub>t</sub></i> admits a Lagrangian torus fibration <i>f<sub>t</sub>:X<sub>t</sub> -&gt; B</i> onto a base <i>B</i> of real dimension <i>n</i>, and that as <i>t -&gt; 0</i> the variety <i>X<sub>t</sub></i> endowed with its Ricci-flat K&auml;hler metric collapses to the space <i>B</i>, endowed with a <i>Z</i>-affine structure. The goal of this talk is to explain how to construct the space <i>B</i> with its extra structures using non-archimedean geometry. In particular, in the case of Fermat threefolds in <b>P</b><sup>4</sup>, using the toric geometry of the ambient space, we are able to construct a non-archimedean SYZ fibration inducing on <i>B</i> the affine structure naturally induced by the Gromov&ndash;Hausdorff convergence recently proved by Yang Li. This is based on work joint with Enrica Mazzon.</li>

        <li class="abstract">Linear systems of divisors on blow-ups of projective spaces in points in general positions are connected to certain polynomial interpolation problems. While for the case of plane curves and of surfaces in 3-space there are conjectures, although long standing, formulated by M. Nagata, B. Segre and others, in the higher dimensional case we are in the dark. However, when the number of points is not too large and the blow-ups are Mori dream spaces, an action of the Weyl group on cycles of any codimension governs the birational behaviour of the space on the one hand, and the stable base locus of divisors on the other hand, and it yields a solution to the interpolation problem.

        <li class="title">Residual categories of quadric surface bundles</li>
        <li class="abstract">The residual category (or the Kuznetsov component) of a quadric surface bundle is the non-trivial component in the derived category. It is equivalent to the twisted derived category of a double cover over the base when the quadric surface bundle has simple degeneration (fibers have corank at most 1). I will consider quadric surface bundles with fibers of corank at most 2 and describe their residual categories as (twisted) derived categories of some scheme in two situations: (1) when the bundle has a smooth section; (2) when the total space is smooth and the base is a smooth surface. The results can be applied to describe the residual categories of a (partial) resolution of nodal quintic del Pezzo threefolds, cubic fourfolds containing a plane and certain complete intersections of quadrics.</li>

        <li class="title">Buildings as classifying spaces for toric principal bundles</li>
        <li class="abstract">A building is a certain infinite combinatorial object (abstract simplicial complex) associated to a (semisimple) linear algebraic group which encodes the relative position of maximal tori and parabolic/parahoric subgroups in it. After an introduction to buildings and discussing some examples from linear algebra, I will talk about some recent results on classification of torus equivariant principal G-bundles on toric varieties (over a field) and toric schemes (over a discrete valuation ring). These are extensions of Klyachko's classification of torus equivariant vector bundles on toric varieties. For this we introduce the notions of &quot;piecewise linear map&quot; to the Tits building and &quot;piecewise affine map&quot; to the Bruhat-Tits building of a linear algebraic group. This is joint work with Chris Manon (Kentucky) and Boris Tsvelikhovsky (Pittsburgh).</li>

        <li class="title">Descendent series for Hilbert schemes of points on surfaces</li>
        <li class="abstract">Structure often emerges from Hilbert schemes of points on varieties when the underlying variety is fixed but the number of points parametrized varies. Some examples of such structure come from integrals of tautological bundles, which arise in geometric and physical computations. When compiled into generating series, these integrals display interesting functional properties. I will give an overview of results on such series; the focus will be on K-theoretic descendent series for Hilbert schemes on surfaces, certain series formed from holomorphic Euler characteristics of tautological bundles. In particular, I will explain how to see that the K-theoretic descendent series are expansions of rational functions.</li>

        <li class="title">Enumerative geometry in the extended tropical vertex group</li>
        <li class="abstract">The extended tropical vertex group is a pro-nilptotent Lie group, which has been introduced in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.09956">arXiv:1912.09956</a> studying the relationship between scattering diagrams and infinitesimal deformations of holomorphic pairs. Scattering diagrams were introduced by Kontsevich and Soibelman in the context of mirror symmetry. They are defined algebraically, in terms of pro-nilpotent Lie groups, but in many applications they have a combinatorial structure which encodes enumerative geometric data (as Donaldson&ndash;Thomas invariants, Gromov&ndash;Witten invariants,...). In particular, Gross, Pandharipande and Siebert showed how to compute genus zero log Gromov&ndash;Witten invariants for <b>P</b><sup>2</sup> via scattering diagrams in the so called tropical vertex group. In this talk, I will discuss a possible generalization regarding how to compute genus zero relative Gromov&ndash;Witten invariants for toric <b>P</b><sup>2</sup> using scattering diagrams in the extended tropical vertex group.</li>

        <li class="title">On K-stability of some singular del Pezzo surfaces</li>
        <li class="abstract">There has been a lot of development recently in understanding the existence of Kahler-Einstein metrics on Fano manifolds due to the Yau-Tian-Donaldson conjecture, which gives us a way of looking at this problem in terms of the notion of K-stability. In particular, this problem is solved in totality for smooth del Pezzo surfaces by Tian. For del Pezzo surfaces with quotient singularities, there are partial results. In this talk, we will consider singular del Pezzo surfaces of indices 2 and 3, which are quasi-smooth, well-formed hypersurfaces in weighted projective space, and understand what we can say about their K-stability. This is joint work with In-Kyun Kim and Joonyeong Won.</li>

        <li class="abstract">Given a compact K&auml;hler manifold it is a classical question, related to K-stability, whether it admits a K&auml;hler metric of constant scalar curvature (cscK metric for short). In this talk we prove that there always exist cscK metrics on compact K&auml;hler manifolds with nef canonical bundle, thus on all smooth minimal models, and also on the blowup of any such manifold. This confirms an expectation of Jian-Shi-Song and extends well-known results of Aubin and Yau to the nef case, giving a large new class of examples of cscK manifolds. The tools used are from the variational approach in K&auml;hler geometry, and some related results on stability thresholds and Donaldson's J-equation are discussed along the way.</li>

        <li class="abstract">Mirror symmetry is a predicted equivalence between certain aspects of algebraic geometry and symplectic geometry. The Strominger&ndash;Yau&ndash;Zaslow conjecture proposes that this equivalence appears on pairs of algebraic and symplectic spaces which have dual torus fibrations. In this pretalk, we look at a first example: the complex torus which is fibered by real tori, and the cotangent bundle of the real torus. We'll see how both geometries can be related to affine geometry on real <i>n</i>-dimensional space.</li>

        <li class="title">Realizing tropical curves via mirror symmetry</li>
        <li class="abstract">The tropicalization map associates to each curve in the algebraic <i>n</i>-torus a piecewise linear object (tropical curve) in real <i>n</i>-dimensional space. Given a tropical curve, a natural question is if it can arise as the tropicalization of some algebraic curve. If this is the case we say that the tropical curve is realizable. Determining good realizability criteria for tropical curves remains an important part of tropical geometry since Mikhalkin provided examples of non-realizable tropical curves. We explore the following strategy for realizing tropical curves:
            <ul>
                <li><i>(1)</i> Produce a Lagrangian submanifold of the cotangent bundle of the torus whose moment map projection approximates the tropical curve;</li>
                <li><i>(2)</i> Use homological mirror symmetry  to obtain a mirror algebraic sheaf;</li>
                <li><i>(3)</i> Show that the tropicalization of the support of this sheaf is the original tropical curve.</li>
            </ul>
            We will give full answers to <i>(1)</i> and <i>(3)</i>, and explain why <i>(2)</i> is fairly subtle. As applications, we will obtain some new and known realizability statements for tropical curves.</li>

        <li class="abstract">The homological mirror symmetry conjecture predicts a correspondence between the derived category of coherent sheaves of a variety and the symplectic data (packaged in the Fukaya category) of its mirror object. Motivated by this, we construct exceptional collections for (the smooth stacks associated with) a family of log del Pezzo surfaces known as the Johnson-Kollar series. These surfaces have quotient, non-Gorenstein, singularities. Thus, our computation will include on the one hand an application of the special McKay correspondence, and on the other the study of their minimal resolutions, which are birational to a degree 2 del Pezzo surface. This is all joint work with Giulia Gugiatti.</li>

        <li class="abstract">Birational involutions of the projective plane (or, equivalently, automorphisms of the field of rational functions in two variables of order 2) were studied already by the Italian school of algebraic geometry — Bertini, Castelnuovo, and Enriques. However, their explicit and complete description was obtained by Beauville and Bayle only in 2000 and only in the case of a complex projective plane. It turns out that for planes over algebraically non-closed fields the situation is much more complicated. In the first part of the talk, I will review what is known about birational involutions of projective planes over various fields. In the second part, I will talk about the joint work with I. Cheltsov, F. Mangolt and S. Zimmerman, in which we classified birational involutions of the real projective plane.</li>

        <li class="abstract">Weiestrass points and Weierstrass semigroups are classical objects of study in Algebraic Geometry. The problem of determining which semigroups arise as Weierstrass semigroups of a curve goes back to Hurwitz in 1893. After the advent of tropical geometry, a divisor theory on graphs was developed by Baker and Norine, and later extended to metric graphs (namely, abstract tropical curves) by Gathmann and Kerber, and Mikhalkin and Zharkov. In this talk we present two natural tropical analogues of Weierstrass semigroups on graphs, called rank and functional Weierstrass sets, first appeared in a work of Kang, Matthews and Peachey. We present some results on these two objects and their interplay.</li>

        <li class="title">Fujita vanishing, sufficiently ample line bundles, and cactus varieties</li>
        <li class="abstract">For a fixed projective manifold <i>X</i>, we say that a property <i>P(L)</i> (where <i>L</i> is a line bundle on <i>X</i>) is satisfied by sufficiently ample line bundles if there exists a line bundle <i>M</i> on <i>X</i> such that <i>P(L)</i> hold for any <i>L</i> with <i>L-M</i> ample. I will discuss which properties of line bundles are satisfied by the sufficiently ample line bundles - for example, can you figure out before the talk, whether a sufficiently ample line bundle must be very ample? A basic ingredient used to study this concept is Fujita's vanishing theorem, which is an analogue of Serre's vanishing for sufficiently ample line bundles. At the end of the talk I will define cactus varieties (an analogue of secant varieties) and sketch a proof that cactus varieties to sufficiently ample embeddings of <i>X</i> are (set-theoretically) defined by minors of matrices with linear entries. The topic is closely related to conjectures of Eisenbud-Koh-Stillman (for curves) and Sidman-Smith (for any varieties). The new ingredients are based on joint work in preparation with Weronika Buczy&#324;ska and &#321;ucja Farnik.</li>

        <li class="title">McKay correspondence for isolated Gorenstein singularities</li>
        <li class="abstract">The McKay correspondence is a (natural) correspondence between the (non-trivial) irreducible representations of a finite subgroup <i>G</i> of <i>SL(2,<b>C</b>)</i> and the irreducible components of the exceptional divisor of a minimal resolution of the associated quotient singularity <i><b>C</b><sup>2</sup>//G</i>. A geometric construction for this correspondence was given by Gonz&aacute;lez-Sprinberg and Verdier, who showed that the two sets also correspond bijectively to the set of indecomposable reflexive modules on the quotient singularity. This was generalised to higher dimensional quotient singularities (i.e., quotient of <i><b>C</b><sup>n</sup></i> by a finite subgroup of <i>SL(n,<b>C</b>)</i>) by Ito-Reid, where the above sets were substituted by certain smaller subsets. It was further generalised to more general quotient singularities by Bridgeland-King-Reid, Iyama-Wemyss and others, using the language of derived categories. In this talk, I will survey past results and discuss what happens for the isolated Gorenstein singularities case (not necessarily a quotient singularity). If time permits, I will discuss applications to Matrix factorization. This is joint work in progress with J. F. de Bobadilla and A. Romano-Velazquez.</li>

            <li class="abstract">The Seshadri constant of a polarized variety <i>(X,L)</i> at a point <i>x</i> measures how positive is the polarization <i>L</i> at <i>x</i>. If <i>x</i> is very general, the Seshadri constant does not depend on <i>x</i>, and captures global information on <i>X</i>. Inspired by ideas from the Geometry of Numbers, we introduce in this talk successive Seshadri minima, such that the first one is the Seshadri constant at a point, and the last one is the width of the polarization at the point. Assuming the point is very general, we obtain two results: a) the product of the successive Seshadri minima is proportional to the volume of the polarization; b) if <i>X</i> is toric, the <i>i</i>-th successive Seshadri constant is proportional to the <i>i</i>-th successive minima of a suitable 0-symmetric convex body.

            <li class="title">The tropical geometry of monotone Hurwitz numbers</li>
            <li class="abstract">Hurwitz numbers are important enumerative invariants in algebraic geometry. They count branched maps between Riemann surfaces. Equivalently, they enumerate factorizations in the symmetric group. Hurwitz numbers were introduced in the 1890s by Adolf Hurwitz and became central objects of enumerative algebraic geometry in the 1990s through close connections with the so-called Gromov&ndash;Witten theory. This interplay between Hurwitz and Gromov&ndash;Witten theory is an active field of research and led to, among other things, the celebrated ELSV formula. In the last decade, many variants of Hurwitz numbers have been introduced and studied. In particular, the question of connections between these variants of Hurwitz numbers and Gromov&ndash;Witten theory is of great interest. So-called monotone Hurwitz numbers , which originate from the theory of random matrices, are among the most studied variants of Hurwitz numbers. This talk is a progress report of our larger program in which we study the connections between monotone Hurwitz numbers and Gromov&ndash;Witten theory by combinatorial methods of tropical geometry, and whose long-term goal is a proof of the still open conjecture of an ELSV - type formula for double monotone Hurwitz numbers. The talk is based in part on joint work with Reinier Kramer and Danilo Lewanski.</li>

            <li class="abstract">A famous classical result by Gelfand, Kapranov and Zelevinsky provides a combinatorial description of the vertices of the Newton polytope of the <i>A</i>-discriminant (the closure of the set of all non-smooth hypersurfaces defined by polynomials with the given support <i>A</i>). Namely, it gives a surjection from the set of all convex triangulations of the convex hull of the set <i>A</i> with vertices in <i>A</i> (or, equivalently, the set of all possible combinatorial types of smooth tropical hypersurfaces defined by tropical polynomials with support <i>A</i>) onto the set of vertices of this Newton polytope. In my talk, I will discuss a similar problem for the Morse discriminant — the closure of the set of all polynomials with the given support <i>A</i> which are non-Morse if viewed as polynomial maps. Namely, for a 1-dimensional support set <i>A</i>, there is a surjection from the set of all possible combinatorial types of so-called Morse tropical polynomials onto the vertices of the Newton polytope of the Morse discriminant.</li>

            <li class="title">Computational aspects in orbifold equivalence</li>
            <li class="abstract">Landau-Ginzburg models are a family of physical theories described by some polynomial (or  &quot;potential&quot;) characterized by having an isolated singularity at the origin. Often appearing in mirror-symmetric phenomena, they can be collected in higher categories with nice properties that allow direct computations. In this context, it is possible to introduce an equivalence relation between two different potentials called &quot;orbifold equivalence&quot;. We will present some recent examples of this equivalence, and discuss the computational challenges posed by the search of new ones. Joint work with Timo Kluck.</li>

            <li class="title">Paving tropical ideals</li>
            <li class="abstract">Tropical geometry is a powerful tool in algebraic geometry, which offers a multitude of combinatorial approaches to studying algebraic varieties. This talk will focus on the recent development of tropical commutative algebra by Diane Maclagan and Felipe Rincon. The central object of study is the &quot;tropical Ideal&quot;, which generalizes the structure of polynomial ideals over fields to be suitable for study in the setting of tropical geometry, that is, in polynomial semirings over semifields. All polynomial ideals over a field can be associated to a &quot;realizable&quot; tropical ideal, and it is a non-trivial fact that &quot;non-realizable&quot; tropical ideals exist. In this talk, I will demonstrate how the combinatorics of matroid theory allows us to easily generate a subclass of tropical ideals, called paving tropical ideals, which in turn allows us to prove that most zero-dimensional tropical ideals are not realizable.</li>

            <li class="title">Quantum geometry of log-Calabi Yau surfaces</li>
            <li class="abstract">A log-Calabi Yau surface with maximal boundary, or Looijenga pair, is a pair <i>(X,D)</i> with <i>X</i> a smooth complex projective surface and <i>D</i> a singular anticanonical divisor in <i>X</i>. I will introduce a series of physics-motivated correspondences relating five different classes of enumerative invariants of the pair <i>(X,D)</i>:
                <ul>
                    <li>the log Gromov&ndash;Witten theory of <i>(X,D)</i>,</li>
                    <li>the Gromov&ndash;Witten theory of <i>X</i> twisted by the sum of the dual line bundles to the irreducible components of <i>D</i>,</li>
                    <li>the open Gromov&ndash;Witten theory of special Lagrangians in a toric Calabi&ndash;Yau 3-fold determined by <i>(X,D)</i>,</li>
                    <li>the Donaldson&ndash;Thomas theory of a symmetric quiver specified by <i>(X,D)</i>, and</li>
                    <li>a class of BPS invariants considered in different contexts by Klemm&ndash;Pandharipande, Ionel&ndash;Parker, and Labastida&ndash;Marino&ndash;Ooguri&ndash;Vafa.</li>
                </ul>
                I will also show how the problem of computing all these invariants is closed-form solvable. Based on joint works with P. Bousseau, M. van Garrel, and Y. Schueler.</li>

            <li class="abstract">I will discuss progress on the Calabi problem for Fano 3-folds. The 105 deformation families of smooth Fano 3-folds, were classified by Iskovskikh, Mori and Mukai. We determine whether or not the general member of each of these 105 families admits a K&auml;hler-Einstein metric. In some cases, it is known that while the general member of the family admits a K&auml;hler-Einstein metric, some other member does not. This leads to the problem of determining which members of a deformation family admit a K&auml;hler-Einstein metric when the general member does. This is accomplished for most of the families, and I will present a conjectural picture for some of the remaining families. This is a joint project with Carolina Araujo, Ana-Maria Castravet, Ivan Cheltsov, Kento Fujita, Jesus Martinez-Garcia, Constantin Shramov, Hendrik S&uuml;ss and Nivedita Viswanathan.</li>

            <li class="abstract">For <i>n&gt;=4</i>, the hyperpolygon spaces are a collection of Nakajima quiver varieties in dimension <i>2n-6</i> that have been a useful testing ground for conjectures on conical symplectic varieties. I'll describe joint work in progress with Gwyn Bellamy, Steven Rayan, Travis Schedler and Hartmut Weiss in which we describe completely the birational geometry of these spaces. The case <i>n=5</i> recovers a well-known finite quotient singularity in dimension four, and allows us to provide a uniform construction of all 81 projective crepant resolutions studied in previous work of Donten-Bury&ndash;Wi&#347;niewski. I'll also explain the title of the talk by giving a geometric interpretation of the components of the stability parameter even when it doesn't lie in the positive orthant.</li>

            <li class="abstract">In this talk we show at the example of some surfaces of general type, so called Kanev and Todorov type surfaces, how to construct minimal and canonical models of hypersurfaces in toric varieties. We relate the plurigenera and the Kodaira dimension of the hypersurfaces to a special polytope, known as the Fine interior. Then we study singularities of the canonical models of Kanev/Todorov type surfaces via toric geometry, degenerations of these surfaces and investigate some Hodge theoretic consequences.</li>

            <li class="title">Abelianisation of Meromorphic Connections</li>
            <li class="abstract">There is a natural 1-1 correspondence between Higgs bundles on a compact complex curve and line bundles on an appropriate branched cover. This abelianisation process goes through the direct image functor and it has been fruitful in addressing a variety of problems relating to bundles on curves. We extend this abelianisation correspondence from Higgs bundles to flat bundles. This generalisation involves choosing a certain graph which translates to cohomology as a natural cocycle that exhibits a local deformation of the direct image functor. Furthermore, our abelianisation correspondence extends to lambda-connections and recovers the abelianisation of Higgs bundles as lambda goes to 0. Based in part on joint work in progress with Marco Gualtieri.</li>

            <li class="abstract">Matching fields were introduced by Sturmfels and Zelevinsky to study certain Newton polytopes and more recently have been shown to give rise to toric degenerations of various families of varieties. Whenever a matching field gives rise to a toric degeneration of the Grassmannian, the polytope of the associated toric variety coincides with the matching field polytope. In this talk I will describe combinatorial mutations of matching field polytopes. We will explore properties of polytopes which are preserved by mutation, and we will see that property of giving rise to a toric degeneration is preserved by mutations. This gives us an easy way to generate new families of toric degenerations of the Grassmannian from old. This talk is based on joint work with Akihiro Higashitani and Fatemeh Mohammadi.</li>

            <li class="title">Toric contact cycles in the moduli space of curves</li>
            <li class="abstract">The toric contact cycles are loci in the moduli space of curves that parameterize those curves that admit a morphism to a fixed toric variety, with prescribed tangency data with the toric boundary. The cycles are the fundamental building blocks in higher genus logarithmic Gromov&ndash;Witten theory and are higher dimensional analogues of the double ramification cycles, which have been studied intensely in the last decade. In recent work, Sam Molcho (ETH) and I proved that these cycles lie in the tautological part of the Chow ring of the moduli space of curves. A lesson I learned from this project, and earlier work with Navid Nabijou (Cambridge), is that it can be quite profitable to blend Fulton’s analysis of blowups and strict transforms with logarithmic Gromov&ndash;Witten theory and its virtual class. I’ll try to give a sense of the basic geometric phenomena, and point to some other places where they come up.</li>

In this talk, we show that <i>r<sub>n</sub></i> must grow faster than any polynomial in <i>n</i>, by giving examples of general type with small volume in high dimensions.

            <li class="abstract">Smooth hypersurfaces are classical objects in algebraic geometry since they are the simplest varieties one can define as they are given by only one equation. As such, they have been intensively studied and their geometry has shaped the development of classic and modern algebraic geometry. In this talk, I will first recall some fundamental results concerning the automorphism group of smooth hypersurfaces of the projective space and then I will present some new results obtained in a joint work with Victor Gonzalez-Aguilera and Alvaro Liendo, which are inspired by the classification groups which faithfully act on smooth cubic and quintic threefolds by Oguiso, Wei and Yu. Finally, I will discuss some perspectives and open problems that arise from this.</li>

            <li class="abstract">The combinatorial mutation of a polytope was introduced in the context of the mirror symmetry of Fano manifolds for achieving the classification problem. This operation makes a given polytope another one while keeping some properties. In my talk, I will consider the combinatorial mutation of a polygon associated to a dimer model. A dimer model is a bipartite graph on the real two-torus, and the combinatorics of a dimer model gives rise to a certain lattice polygon. Also, a dimer model enjoys rich information regarding toric geometry associated to that polygon. It is known that for any lattice polygon <i>P</i> there is a dimer model whose associated polygon coincides with <i>P</i>. Thus, there also exists a dimer model giving the lattice polygon obtained as the combinatorial mutation of <i>P</i>. I will observe the relationship between a dimer model giving a lattice polygon <i>P</i> and the one giving the combinatorial mutation of <i>P</i>. In particular, I introduce the operation which I call the deformation of a dimer model, and show that this operation induces the combinatorial mutation of a polygon associated to a dimer model. This talk is based on a joint work with A. Higashitani.</li>

            <li class="abstract">A Newton-Okounkov body is a convex set associated to a projective variety, equipped with a valuation. These bodies generalize the theory of Newton polytopes and the correspondence between polytopes and projective toric varieties. Work of Kaveh-Manon gives an explicit link between tropical geometry and Newton-Okounkov bodies. We use this link to describe a wall-crossing phenomenon for Newton-Okounkov bodies. As an example, we describe wall-crossing formula in the case of the Grassmannian <i>Gr(2,m)</i>. This is joint work with Megumi Harada.</li>

            <li class="title">Parabolic Higgs bundles on toric varieties</li>
            <li class="abstract">In this talk I will explain a version of Simpson’s non-abelian Hodge correspondence on a toric variety <i>X</i>. There is a natural 1-1 correspondence between stable parabolic Higgs bundles on <i>X</i> and irreducible representations of the fundamental group of the big torus. This correspondence reduces to a correspondence between toric vector bundles and integral unitary representations in a suitable sense. In this story the spherical Tits building will have a surprise appearance. The main result suggests (at least to me) that there is a yet-to-be-discovered logarithmic incarnation of the non-abelian Hodge correspondence.</li>

            <li class="title">Polytopes, periods, degenerations</li>
            <li class="abstract">A lattice polytope describes a projective toric variety and a regular subdivision of the polytope describes a flat degeneration of the toric variety. It is instructive to deform the degenerating family in a way that makes the geometry non-toric and produces a more interesting real torus fibration on the fibres of the degeneration. I am going to explain a simple formula that permits the easy computation of period integrals for the deformed families. This approach to periods doesn't require any differential equations and is flexible enough to give proofs for strong results about Gross-Siebert's degenerating families obtained from wall structures. The talk is based on joint work with Bernd Siebert.</li>

            <li class="title">Counting bitangents of plane quartics - tropical, real and arithmetic</li>
            <li class="abstract">A smooth plane quartic defined over the complex numbers has precisely 28 bitangents. This result goes back to Pluecker. In the tropical world, the situation is different. One can define equivalence classes of tropical bitangents of which there are 7, and each has 4 lifts over the complex numbers. Over the reals, we can have 4, 8, 16 or 28 bitangents. The avoidance locus of a real quartic is the set in the dual plane consisting of all lines which do not meet the quartic. Every connected component of the avoidance locus has precisely 4 bitangents in its closure. For any field <i>k</i> of characteristic not equal to 2 and with a non-Archimedean valuation which allows us to tropicalize, we show that a tropical bitangent class of a quartic either has 0 or 4 lifts over <i>k</i>. This way of grouping into sets of 4 which exists tropically and over the reals is intimately connected: roughly, tropical bitangent classes can be viewed as tropicalizations of closures of connected components of the avoidance locus. Arithmetic counts offer a bridge connecting real and complex counts, and we investigate how tropical geometry can be used to study this bridge. This talk is based on joint work with Maria Angelica Cueto, and on joint work in progress with Sam Payne and Kristin Shaw.</li>

            <li class="abstract">I will discuss a class of affine algebraic varieties associated to positive braids, their relation to open positroid strata in Grassmannians and their cluster structures. First, I will introduce the objects of interest, with the necessary ingredients, and motivate the problem at hand. Then we will discuss in detail how the study of a DG-algebra associated to certain links may allow us to better understand the algebraic (and cluster) geometry of Richardson and positroid varieties. Explicit examples of this interplay between topology and algebraic geometry will be illustrated. At a more conceptual level, the talk brings to bear insight from symplectic topology to better understand positroid varieties. This is joint work with E. Gorsky, M. Gorsky and J. Simental.</li>

            <li class="title">Quantum theta bases for quantum cluster algebras</li>
            <li class="abstract">One of the central goals in the study of cluster algebras is to better understand various canonical bases and positivity properties of the cluster algebras and their quantizations. Gross-Hacking-Keel-Kontsevich (GHKK) applied ideas from mirror symmetry to construct so-called "theta bases" for cluster algebras which satisfy all the desired positivity properties, thus proving several conjectures regarding cluster algebras.  I will discuss joint work with Ben Davison in which we combine the techniques used by GHKK with ideas from the DT theory of quiver representations to quantize the GHKK construction, thus producing quantum theta bases and proving the desired quantum positivity properties.</li>

            <li class="abstract">I will explain recent progress on classifying finite dimensional Jacobi algebras on the two loop quiver. This is a purely algebraic problem, which at first sight is both seemingly hopeless and seemingly detached from any form of reality or wider motivation. There are two surprises: first, the problem is not hopeless, and parts of the answer are in fact very beautiful. Second, this has immediate and surprising consequences to both 3-fold flops and 3-fold divisor-to-curve contractions, their curve invariants and their conjectural classification. This is joint work with Gavin Brown.</li>

            <li class="title">A tale of two widths: lattice and Gromov</li>
            <li class="abstract">To a polytope <i>P</i> whose facet normals are rational one can associate two geometric objects: a symplectic toric domain <i>X<sub>P</sub></i> and a polarised toric algebraic variety <i>Y<sub>P</sub></i>, which can also be viewed as a potentially singular symplectic space. A basic invariant of a symplectic manifold <i>X</i> is its Gromov width: essentially the size of the largest ball that can be 'symplectically' embedded in <i>X</i>. A conjecture of Averkov-Hofscheier-Nill proposed a combinatorial bound for the Gromov width of <i>Y<sub>P</sub></i>, which I recently verified in dimension two with Julian Chaidez. I’ll discuss the proof, which goes via various symplectic and algebraic invariants with winsome combinatorial interpretations in the toric case. If there’s time, I’ll discuss ongoing work and new challenges for a similar result in higher dimensions.</li>

            <li class="abstract">The twisted connected sum construction of Kovalev produces many examples of closed Riemannian 7-manifolds with holonomy group <i>G<sub>2</sub></i> (a special class of Ricci-flat manifolds), starting from complex algebraic geometry data like Fano 3-folds. If the pieces admit automorphisms, then adding an extra twist to the construction yields examples with a wider variety of topological features. I will describe the constructions and outline how one can use them to produce example of e.g. closed 7-manifolds with disconnected moduli space of holonomy <i>G<sub>2</sub></i> metrics, or pairs of <i>G<sub>2</sub></i>-manifolds that homeomorphic but not diffeomorphic. This is joint work with Diarmuid Crowley and Sebastian Goette.</li>

            <li class="abstract">In this talk I will present the main results of my thesis, a tropical correspondence theorem for log Calabi&ndash;Yau pairs <i>(X,D)</i> consisting of a smooth del Pezzo surface <i>X</i> of degree <i>&gt;=3</i> and a smooth anticanonical divisor <i>D</i>. The easiest example of such a pair is <i>(<b>P</b><sup>2</sup>,E)</i>, where <i>E</i> is an elliptic curve. I will explain how the genus zero logarithmic Gromov&ndash;Witten invariants of <i>X</i> with maximal tangency to <i>D</i> are related to tropical curves in the dual intersection complex of <i>(X,D)</i> and how they can be read off from the consistent wall structure appearing in the Gross-Siebert program. The novelty in this correspondence is that <i>D</i> is smooth but non-toric, leading to log singularities in the toric degeneration that have to be resolved.</li>

            <li class="title">Tropical <i>F</i>-polynomials and Cluster Algebras</li>
            <li class="abstract">The representation-theoretic interpretations of <i>g</i>-vectors and <i>F</i>-polynomials are two fundamental ingredients in the (additive) categorification of cluster algebras. We knew that the <i>g</i>-vectors are related to the presentation spaces. We introduce the tropical <i>F</i>-polynomial <i>f<sub>M</sub></i> of a quiver representation <i>M</i>, and explain its interplay with the general presentation for any finite-dimensional basic algebra. As a consequence, we give a presentation of the Newton polytope <i>N(M)</i> of <i>M</i>. We propose an algorithm to determine the generic Newton polytopes, and show it works for path algebras. As an application, we give a representation-theoretic interpretation of Fock-Goncharov's cluster duality pairing. We also study many combinatorial aspects of <i>N(M)</i>, such as faces, the dual fan and 1-skeleton. We conjecture that the coefficients of a cluster monomial corresponding to vertices are all 1, and the coefficients inside the Newton polytope are saturated. We show the conjecture holds for acyclic cluster algebras. We specialize the above general results to the cluster-finite algebras and the preprojective algebras of Dynkin type.</li>

            <li class="abstract">The theory of K3 surfaces with symplectic involutions and their quotients is now a well understood classicial subject thanks to foundational works of Nikulin, and van Geemen and Sarti.  In this talk we will try to develop an analogous theory in the context of hyperkahler fourfolds of K3<sup>[2]</sup> type. First, we will present a latttice theoretic classification of such  fourfolds which admit a symplectic involution. Then we will investigate the associated quotients that we call Nikulin orbifolds. These are orbifolds which admit a symplectic form on the smooth locus and hence are special cases of so called hyperkahler orbifolds. Finally, we shall discuss families of Nikulin orbifolds and their deformations called hyperkahler orbifolds of Nikulin type. As an application, we will provide a description of the first known example of a complete family of projective hyperkahler orbifolds. This is joint work with A. Garbagnati, C. Camere and G. Kapustka.</li>

            <li class="abstract">Calabi&ndash;Yau manifolds (in the strict sense) form an important class in the classification of algebraic varieties. One can also consider its generalisation by removing the projectivity assumption. It was previously known that there are infinitely many topological types of non-K&auml;hler Calabi&ndash;Yau 3-folds. In this talk, I will present construction of such examples in higher dimensions by smoothing normal crossing varieties. The key tools of the construction are some isomorphisms between general rational elliptic surfaces which induce isomorphisms between Calabi&ndash;Yau manifolds of Schoen type.</li>

I will discuss joint work with Gandini, Hering, Mohammadi, Rajchgot, Wheeler, and Yu in which we give a different proof of this theorem that removes the characteristic assumption. An application is a tropical Bertini theorem.</li>

            <li class="title">Non-archimedean approach to mirror symmetry and to degenerations of varieties</li>
            <li class="abstract">Mirror symmetry is a fast-moving research area at the boundary between mathematics and theoretical physics. Originated from observations in string theory, it suggests that complex Calabi&ndash;Yau manifolds should come in mirror pairs, in the sense that geometrical information of a Calabi&ndash;Yau manifold can be read through invariants of its mirror. In the first part of the talk, I will introduce some geometrical ideas inspired by mirror symmetry. In particular, I will go through the main steps which relate mirror symmetry to non-archimedean geometry and the theory of Berkovich spaces. In the second part, I will describe a combinatorial object, the so-called dual complex of a degeneration of varieties. This emerges in many contexts of algebraic geometry, including mirror symmetry where moreover it comes equipped with an integral affine structure. I will show how the techniques of Berkovich geometry give a new insight into the study of dual complexes and their integral affine structure. This is based on a joint work with Morgan Brown and a work in progress with L&eacute;onard Pille-Schneider.</li>

I will give a general introduction to Hochschild cohomology and this decomposition, and explain what it looks like for partial flag varieties (joint work with Maxim Smirnov) and Fano 3-folds (joint work with Enrico Fatighenti and Fabio Tanturri).</li>

            <li class="abstract">Start with a rational surface <i>Y</i> admitting a decomposition of its anticanonical divisor into at least two smooth nef components. We associate five curve counting theories to this Looijenga pair: 1) all genus stable log maps with maximal tangency to each boundary component; 2) genus zero stable maps to the local Calabi&ndash;Yau surface obtained by twisting <i>Y</i> by the sum of the line bundles dual to the components of the boundary; 3) the all genus open Gromov&ndash;Witten theory of a toric Calabi&ndash;Yau threefold associated to the Looijenga pair; 4) the Donaldson-Thomas theory of a symmetric quiver specified by the Looijenga pair and 5) BPS invariants associated to the various curve counting theories. In this joint work with Pierrick Bousseau and Andrea Brini, we provide closed-form solutions to essentially all of the associated invariants and show that the theories are equivalent. I will start by describing the geometric transitions from one geometry to the other, then give an overview of the curve counting theories and their relations. I will end by describing how the scattering diagrams of Gross and Siebert are a natural place to count stable log maps.</li>

            <li class="title">Log geometry and Chow theory</li>
            <li class="abstract">Log geometry has become a central tool in enumerative geometry over the past years, providing means to study many degenerations situations. Unfortunately much of the theory is complicated by the fact that products of log schemes differ from products of schemes. In this talk I will introduce a gadget which replaces Chow theory for log schemes, reproducing many familiar tools such as virtual pullback in the context of log geometry.</li>

            <li class="title">Tautological bundles of matroids</li>
            <li class="abstract">Recent advances in matroid theory via tropical geometry broadly fall into two themes: One concerns the K-theory of Grassmannians, and the other concerns the intersection theory of wonderful compactifications. How do these two themes talk to each other?  We introduce the notion of tautological bundles of matroids to unite these two themes. As a result, we give a geometric interpretation of the Tutte polynomial of a matroid that unifies several previous works as its corollaries, deduce new log-concavity statements, and answer few conjectures in the literature. This is an ongoing project with Andrew Berget, Hunter Spink, and Dennis Tseng.</li>

            <li class="title">Convexity in tropical spaces and compactifications of cluster varieties</li>
            <li class="abstract">Cluster varieties are a relatively new, broadly interesting class of geometric objects that generalise toric varieties. Convexity is a key notion in toric geometry. For instance, projective toric varieties are defined by convex lattice polytopes. In this talk, I'll explain how convexity generalises to the cluster world, where &quot;polytopes&quot; live in a tropical space rather than a vector space and &quot;convex polytopes&quot; define projective compactifications of cluster varieties. Time permitting, I'll conclude with two exciting applications of this more general notion of convexity: 1) an intrinsic version of Newton-Okounkov bodies and 2) a possible cluster version of a classic toric mirror symmetry construction due to Batyrev. Based on joint work with Man-Wai Cheung and Alfredo N&aacute;jera Ch&aacute;vez.</li>

            <li class="title">Refined Donaldson-Thomas theory of threefold flops</li>
            <li class="abstract">DT invariants are virtual counts of semistable objects in the derived category of a Calabi&ndash;Yau variety, which can be calculated at various levels of refinement. An interesting family of CY variety which are of particular interest to the MMP are threefold flopping curves, and in this talk I will explain how to understand their DT theory. The key point is that the stability conditions on the derived categories can be understood via tilting equivalences, which can be seen as the analogue of cluster mutations in this setting. I will show that these equivalences induce wall-crossing formulas, and use this to reduce the DT theory of a flop to a comprehensible set of curve-counting invariants, which can be computed for several examples. These computations produce new evidence for a conjecture of Pandharipande-Thomas, and show that refined DT invariants are not enough to completely classify flops.</li>

            <li class="title">Pure codimensionality of wobbly bundles</li>
            <li class="abstract">Higgs bundles on smooth projective curves were introduced by Hitchin as solutions to gauge equations motivated by physics. They can be seen as points of <i>T*N</i>, where <i>N</i> is the moduli space of vector bundles on the curve. The topology of the moduli space of Higgs bundles is determined by the nilpotent cone, which is a reducible scheme containing the zero section of <i>T*N---&gt;N</i>. Inside this section, wobbly bundles are particularly important, as this is the locus where any other component intersects <i>N</i>. In fact, this implies that the geometry of the nilpotent cone can be described in terms of wobbly bundles. In this talk I will explain an inductive method to prove pure codimensionality of the wobbly locus, as announced in a paper by Laumon from the 80's. We expect our method to yield moreover a description of the irreducible components of the nilpotent cone in arbitrary rank.</li>

            <li class="abstract">A toric degeneration is a flat degeneration from a projective variety to a toric variety, which can be used to apply the theory of toric varieties to other projective varieties. In this talk, we discuss relations among the following three constructions of toric degenerations: representation theory, Newton-Okounkov bodies, and cluster algebras. More precisely, we construct Newton-Okounkov bodies using cluster structures, and realize representation-theoretic and cluster-theoretic toric degenerations from this framework. As an application, we connect two kinds of representation-theoretic polytopes (string polytopes and Nakashima-Zelevinsky polytopes) by tropicalized cluster mutations. We also discuss relations with combinatorial mutations which was introduced in the context of mirror symmetry for Fano varieties. More precisely, we relate dual polytopes of these representation-theoretic polytopes by combinatorial mutations. This talk is based on joint works with Hironori Oya and Akihiro Higashitani.</li>

            <li class="title">Orientations for DT invariants on quasi-projective Calabi&ndash;Yau 4-folds</li>
            <li class="abstract">Donaldson-Thomas type invariants in complex dimension 4 have attracted a lot of attention in the past few years. I will give a brief overview of how one can count coherent sheaves on Calabi&ndash;Yau 4-folds. Inherent to the definition of DT4 invariants is the notion of orientations on moduli spaces of sheaves/perfect complexes. For virtual fundamental classes and virtual structure sheaves to be well-defined, one needs to prove orientability. The result of Cao-Gross-Joyce does this for projective CY 4-folds. However, computations are more feasible in the non-compact setting using localization formulae, where the fixed point loci inherit orientations from global ones, and orientations of the virtual normal bundles come into play. I will explain how to use real determinant line bundles of Dirac operators on the double of the original Calabi&ndash;Yau manifold to construct orientations on the moduli stack of compactly supported perfect complexes, moduli schemes of stable pairs and Hilbert schemes. These are controlled by choices of orientations in K-theory and satisfy compatibility under direct sums. If time allows, I will discuss the connection between the sings obtained from comparing orientations and universal wall-crossing formulae of Joyce using vertex algebras.</li>

            <li class="title">Understanding the flop-flop autoequivalence using spherical functors</li>
            <li class="abstract">The homological interpretation of the Minimal Model Program conjectures that flips should correspond to embeddings of derived categories, and flops to equivalences. Even if the conjecture doesn't provide us with a preferred functor, there is an obvious choice: the pull-push via the fibre product. When this approach work, we obtain an interesting autoequivalence of either side of the flop, known as the &quot;flop-flop autoequivalence&quot;. Understanding the structure of this functor (e.g. does it split as the composition of simpler functors?) is an interesting problem, and it has been extensively studied. In this talk I will explain that there is a natural, i.e. arising from the geometry, way to realise the &quot;flop-flop autoequivalence&quot; as the inverse of a spherical twist, and that this presentation can help us shed light on the structure of the autoequivalence itself.</li>

            <li class="title">Towards global homological mirror symmetry for genus 2 curves</li>
            <li class="abstract">The first part of the talk will discuss work in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.04227">arXiv:1908.04227 [math.SG]</a> on constructing a Donaldson-Fukaya-Seidel type category for the generalized SYZ mirror of a genus 2 curve. We will explain the categorical mirror correspondence on the cohomological level. The key idea uses that a 4-torus is SYZ mirror to a 4-torus. So if we view the complex genus 2 curve as a hypersurface of a 4-torus <i>V</i>, a mirror can be constructed as a symplectic fibration with fiber given by the dual 4-torus <i>V^</i>. Hence on categories, line bundles on <i>V</i> are restricted to the genus 2 curve while fiber Lagrangians of <i>V^</i> are parallel transported over U-shapes in the base of the mirror. Next we describe ongoing work with H. Azam, H. Lee, and C-C. M. Liu on extending the result to a global statement, namely allowing the complex and symplectic structures to vary in their real six-dimensional families. The mirror statement for this more general result relies on work of A. Kanazawa and S-C. Lau.</li>

            <li class="abstract">Aspinwall stated in 2014 that an exoflop &quot;occurs in the gauged linear sigma-model by varying the Kahler form so that a subspace appears to shrink to a point and then reemerge 'outside' the original manifold.&quot; This description may be intangible at first for us to sink our hands into but it turns out to be a great concrete technique that relates to many things we care about as algebraic geometers! We will interpret it in this talk. I will explain in toric geometry concretely what this means for us. Afterwards, I will explain why it’s yet another reason we should listen to our string theoretic friends. Namely, I hope to have enough time to explain how it gives us applications in mirror symmetry and derived categories. Exoflops are a recurring character in my joint work with David Favero (Alberta), Chuck Doran (Alberta), and Dan Kaplan (Birmingham).</li>

            <li class="abstract">A sum of <i>n</i> monomials in <i>n</i> variables is said to be invertible if it is quasi-homogeneous and quasi-smooth (i.e. it has a unique singularity at the origin). To an invertible polynomial <i>w</i>, one can associate a maximal symmetry group, and consider the derived category of equivariant matrix factorizations of <i>w</i>. Joint with David Favero and Tyler Kelly, we prove this category has a full exceptional collection, using a variation of GIT result of Ballard—Favero—Katzarkov. Our proof additionally utilizes the Kreuzer-Skarke classification of invertible polynomials as Thom—Sebastiani sums of Fermat, chain, and loop polynomials. I’ll present a friendly, example-oriented illustration of our approach, review related literature, and discuss applications to mirror symmetry.</li>

            <li class="title">Degenerating tangent curves</li>
            <li class="abstract">It is well-known that a smooth plane cubic <i>E</i> supports 9 flex lines. In higher degrees we may ask an analogous question: &quot;How many degree <i>d</i> curves intersect <i>E</i> in a single point?&quot; The problem of calculating such numbers has fascinated enumerative geometers for decades. Despite being an extremely classical and concrete problem, it was not until the advent of Gromov&ndash;Witten invariants in the 1990s that a general method was discovered. The resulting theory is incredibly rich, and the curve counts satisfy a suite of remarkable properties, some proven and some still conjectural. In this talk I will discuss joint work with Lawrence Barrott, in which we study the behaviour of these tangent curves as the cubic <i>E</i> degenerates to a cycle of lines. Using the machinery of logarithmic Gromov&ndash;Witten theory, we obtain detailed information concerning how the tangent curves degenerate along with <i>E</i>. The theorems we obtain are purely classical, with no reference to Gromov&ndash;Witten theory, but they do not appear to admit a classical proof. No prior knowledge of Gromov&ndash;Witten theory will be assumed.</li>

            <li class="title">Families of Gr&ouml;bner degenerations, Grassmannians, and universal cluster algebras</li>
			<li class="abstract">Let <i>V</i> be the weighted projective variety defined by a weighted homogeneous ideal <i>J</i> and <i>C</i> a maximal cone in the Gr&ouml;bner fan of <i>J</i> with <i>m</i> rays. We construct a  flat family over affine <i>m</i>-space that assembles the Gr&ouml;bner degenerations of <i>V</i> associated with all faces of <i>C</i>. This is a multi-parameter generalization of the classical one-parameter Gr&ouml;bner degeneration associated to a weight. We show that our family can be constructed from Kaveh-Manon's recent work on the classification of toric flat families over toric varieties: it is the pullback of a toric family defined by a Rees algebra with base <i>X<sub>C</sub></i> (the toric variety associated to <i>C</i>) along the universal torsor <b>A</b><i><sup>m</sup></i> -> <i>X<sub>C</sub></i>. If time permits I will explain how to apply this construction to the Grassmannians Gr(<i>2,n</i>) (with Pl&uuml;cker embedding) and Gr(<i>3,6</i>) (with &quot;cluster embedding&quot;). In each case there exists a unique maximal Gr&ouml;bner cone whose associated initial ideal is the Stanley-Reisner ideal of the cluster complex. We show that the corresponding cluster algebra with universal coefficients arises as the algebra defining the flat family associated to this cone. Further, for Gr(<i>2,n</i>) we show how Escobar-Harada's mutation of Newton-Okounkov bodies can be recovered as tropicalized cluster mutation. This is joint work with Fatemeh Mohammadi and Alfredo N&aacute;jera Ch&aacute;vez.</li>

I will discuss the relationship between log symplectic pairs and degenerations of hyperkaehler varieties, and how this naturally leads to a class of log symplectic pairs called log symplectic pairs of &quot;pure weight&quot;. I will discuss results which show that the classification of log symplectic pairs of pure weight is analogous to the classification of log Calabi&ndash;Yau surfaces.

            <li class="abstract">Only recently a separated moduli space for (some) Fano varieties has been constructed by several algebraic geometers: this is the K-moduli stack which parametrises K-semistable Fano varieties and has a separated good moduli space. A natural question is: are these stacks and spaces smooth? This question makes sense because deformations of smooth Fano varieties are unobstructed, so moduli stacks of smooth Fano varieties are smooth. In this talk I will explain how to use toric geometry to construct examples of non-smooth points in the K-moduli stack and the K-moduli space of Fano 3-folds.

            <li class="title">Polytopes, wall crossings, and cluster varieties</li>
			<li class="abstract">Cluster varieties are log Calabi&ndash;Yau varieties which are a union of  algebraic tori glued by birational &quot;mutation&quot; maps. Partial compactifications of the varieties, studied by Gross, Hacking, Keel, and Kontsevich, generalize the polytope construction of toric varieties. However, it is not clear from the definitions how to characterize the polytopes giving compactifications of cluster varieties. We will show how to describe the compactifications easily by broken line convexity. As an application, we will see the non-integral vertex in the Newton Okounkov body of Gr(<i>3,6</i>) comes from broken line convexity. Further, we will also see certain positive polytopes will give us hints about the Batyrev mirror in the cluster setting. The mutations of the polytopes will be related to the almost toric fibration from the symplectic point of view. Finally, we can see how to extend the idea of gluing of tori in Floer theory which then ended up with the Family Floer Mirror for the del Pezzo surfaces of degree 5 and 6. The talk will be based on a series of joint works with Bossinger, Lin, Magee, Najera-Chavez, and Vienna.</li>

            <li class="title">Type <i>D</i> associahedra are unobstructed</li>
			<li class="abstract">Generalised associahedra associated to any root system were introduced by Fomin and Zelevinsky in their study of cluster algebras. For type <i>A</i> root systems, one recovers the classical associahedron parametrizing triangulations of a regular <i>n</i>-gon. For type <i>D</i> root systems, one obtains a polytope parametrizing centrally symmetric triangulations of a <i>2n</i>-gon. In previous work, Jan Christophersen and I showed that the Stanley-Reisner ring of the simplicial complex dual to the boundary of the classical associahedron is unobstructed, that is, has vanishing second cotangent cohomology. This could be used to find toric degenerations of the Grassmannian G(<i>2</i>,<i>n</i>). In this talk, I will describe work-in-progress that generalizes this unobstructedness result to the type <i>D</i> associahedron.</li>

			<li class="abstract">We consider lattice simplices corresponding to weighted projective spaces where one of the weights is 1. We study the integer decomposition property and Ehrhart unimodality for such simplices by focusing on restrictions regarding the multiplicity of each weight. We introduce a necessary condition for when a simplex satisfies the integer decomposition property, and classify those simplices that satisfy it in the case where there are no more than three distinct weights. We also introduce the notion of reflexive stabilizations of a simpex of this type, and show that higher-order reflexive stabilizations fail to be Ehrhart unimodal and fail to have the integer decomposition property. This is joint work with Robert Davis, Morgan Lane, and Liam Solus.</li>

            <li class="title">Constructing Laurent polynomial mirrors for quiver flag zero loci</li>
			<li class="abstract">All smooth Fano varieties of dimension at most three can be constructed as either toric complete intersections (subvarieties of toric varieties) or quiver ﬂag zero loci (subvarieties of quiver ﬂag varieties). Conjecturally, Fano varieties are expected to mirror certain Laurent polynomials. The construction of mirrors of Fano toric complete intersections is well-understood. In this talk, I'll discuss evidence for this conjecture by proposing a method of constructing mirrors for Fano quiver flag zero loci. A key step of the construction is via ﬁnding toric degenerations of the ambient quiver ﬂag varieties. These degenerations generalise the Gelfand-Cetlin degeneration of flag varieties, which in the Grassmannian case has an important role in the cluster structure of its coordinate ring.</li>

			<li class="abstract">The naive analogue of the N&eacute;ron-Ogg-Shafarevich criterion fails for K3 surfaces, that is, there exist K3 surfaces over Henselian, discretely valued fields <b>K</b>, with unramified etale cohomology groups, but which do not admit good reduction over <b>K</b>. Assuming potential semi-stable reduction, I will show how to correct this by proving that a K3 surface has good reduction if and only if is second cohomology is unramified, and the associated Galois representation over the residue field coincides with the second cohomology of a certain &quot;canonical reduction&quot; of <i>X</i>.

            <li class="title">Semi-orthogonal decompositions and discriminants</li>
			<li class="abstract">The derived category of a toric variety can usually be decomposed into smaller pieces, by passing through different birational models and applying the &quot;windows&quot; theory relating VGIT and derived categories. There are many choices involved and the decompositions are not unique. We prove a Jordan-Holder result, that the multiplicities of the pieces are independent of choices. If the toric variety is Calabi&ndash;Yau then there are no decompositions, instead the theory produces symmetries of the derived category. Physics predicts that these all these symmetries  form an action of the fundamental group of the &quot;FI parameter space&quot;. I'll explain why our Jordan-Holder result is necessary for this prediction to work, and state a conjecture (based on earlier work of Aspinwall-Plesser-Wang) relating our multiplicities to the geometry of the FI parameter space. This is joint work with Alex Kite.</li>

            <li class="abstract">Line bundles <i>L</i> on projective toric varieties can be understood as formal differences <i>(&Delta;<sup>+</sup>-&Delta;<sup>-</sup>)</i> of convex polyhedra in the character lattice. We show how it is possible to use this language for understanding the cohomology of <i>L</i> by studying the set-theoretic difference <i>(&Delta;<sup>-</sup>\&Delta;<sup>+</sup>)</i>. Moreover, when interpreting these cohomology groups as certain Ext-groups, we demonstrate how the approach via <i>(&Delta;<sup>-</sup>\&Delta;<sup>+</sup>)</i> leads to a direct description of the associated extensions. The first part is joint work with Jarek Buczinski, Lars Kastner, David Ploog, and Anna-Lena Winz; the second is work in progress with Amelie Flatt.</li>

            <li class="abstract">Let <i>&Gamma;</i> be the closure of the set of pairs <i>(A,A<sup>-1</sup>)</i> of symmetric matrices of size <i>n</i>. In other words, <i>&Gamma;</i> is the graph of the inversion map on the space Sym<sub><i>n</i></sub> of symmetric matrices of size <i>n</i>. What is the cohomology class of <i>&Gamma;</i> in the product of projective spaces? Equivalently, what is the degree of the variety <i>L<sup>-1</sup></i> obtained as the closure of the set of inverses of matrices from a generic linear subspace <i>L</i> of Sym<sub><i>n</i></sub>? This question is interesting in its own right but it is also motivated by algebraic statistics. In my talk, I will explain how to invert a matrix using a <b>C</b>* action on Grassmannians, relate the above question to classical enumerative problems about quadrics, and give several possible answers.

            <li class="abstract">This talk will survey aspects of mirror symmetry for ten families of non-compact hyperk&auml;hler manifolds on which the dynamics of one of the Painlev&eacute; equations is naturally defined. They each have a pair of natural realisations: one as the complement of a singular fibre of a rational elliptic surface and another as the complement of a triangle of lines in a (singular) cubic surface. The two realisations relate closely to a space of stability conditions and a cluster variety of a quiver respectively, providing a perspective on SYZ mirror symmetry for these manifolds.</li>

            <li class="abstract">The moduli continuity method, pioneered by Odaka, Spotti and Sun, allows us to explicitly provide algebraic charts of the Gromov&ndash;Hausdorff compactification of (possibly singular) K&auml;hler-Einstein metrics. Assuming we can provide a homeomorphism to some 'known' algebraic compactification (customarily, a GIT one) the method allows us to determine which Fano varieties (or more generally log Fano pairs) are K-polystable in a given deformation family. In this talk we provide the first examples of compactification of the moduli of log Fano pairs for the simplest deformation family: that of projective space and a hypersurface, and mention related results for cubic surfaces. This is joint work with Patricio Gallardo and Cristiano Spotti.</li>

            <li class="title">Skein-triangulated representations of generalised braids</li>
            <li class="abstract">Ordinary braid group Br<sub>n</sub> is a well-known algebraic structure which encodes configurations of n non-touching strands (&quot;braids&quot;) up to continuous transformations (&quot;isotopies&quot;). A classical result of Khovanov and Thomas states that there is a natural categorical action of Br<sub>n</sub> on the derived category of the cotangent bundle of the variety of complete flags in <b>C</b><i><sup>n</sup></i>. In this talk, I will introduce a new structure: the category GBr<sub>n</sub> of generalised braids. These are the braids whose strands are allowed to touch in a certain way. They have multiple endpoint configurations and can be non-invertible, thus forming a category rather than a group. In the context of triangulated categories, it is natural to impose certain relations which result in the notion of a skein-triangulated representation of GBr<sub>n</sub>. A decade-old conjecture states that there a skein-triangulated action of GBr<sub>n</sub> on the cotangent bundles of the varieties of full and partial flags in <b>C</b><i><sup>n</sup></i>. We prove this conjecture for n = 3. We also show that any categorical action of Br<sub>n</sub> can be lifted to a skein-triangulated action of GBr<sub>n</sub>, which behaves like a categorical nil Hecke algebra. This is a joint work with Rina Anno and Lorenzo De Biase.</li>

Along the way we will uncover several (perhaps) surprising links between this theory and Kodaira's theory of elliptic surfaces. This is joint work with Remkes Kooistra.</li>

            <li class="abstract">The 5-periodic birational map (x, y) -&gt; (y, (1+y)/x) can be interpreted as a mutation between five open torus charts in a del Pezzo surface of degree 5, coming from a cluster algebra structure on the Grassmannian Gr(<i>2,5</i>). This can used to construct a rational elliptic fibration which is the Landau-Ginzburg mirror to dP<sub>5</sub>. I will briefly recap this, and then explain the following 3-dimensional generalisation: the 8-periodic birational map (x, y, z) -&gt; (y, z, (1+y+z)/x) can be used to exhibit a Laurent phenomenon for the orthogonal Grassmannian OGr(<i>5,10</i>) and construct a completely explicit K3 fibration which is mirror to the Fano 3-fold V<sub>12</sub>, as well as some other Fano 3-folds.</li>

            <li class="abstract">Fix a <b>Q</b>-Gorenstein threefold toric singularity X determined by a rational polyhedral cone C in N<sub><b>R</b></sub>, together with a collection of piecewise linear maps (or combinatorial mutations) T<sub>1</sub>,...,T<sub>k</sub> such that the image of <b>C</b>* under the composition of these linear maps is a half space in <b>R</b><i><sup>3</sup></i>. We describe how to perturb the torus fibration X to <b>C</b>*, whose fibres are orbits of the (toric) T<i><sup>3</sup></i> action on X, to a torus fibration on a space X' which is a manifold away from a finite collection of singular points. Around each of these singular points X' has the structure of a terminal cyclic quotient singularity. We outline how to globalise this to construct torus fibrations over 3-dimensional balls which correspond to (partially) smoothing a three-dimensional toric Fano variety to a Fano variety with cyclic quotient terminal singularities. The combinatorial input to this process is closely related to the notion of zero-mutable Laurent polynomial which has been recently studied by Corti, Kasprzyk, and Pitton.</li>

In the smooth case, we have a well-known birational classification dating back to the 19th century. In the singular case, we are still missing a classification just as complete. Nevertheless, in the case of cyclic quotient singularities, we have some interesting constructions.
We will introduce the most crucial aspects of such constructions, which are divided into three main steps: firstly, by analysing the graded rings of such surfaces, we can find a bound on the number of singularities and the relative invariants; secondly, with the help of Mori Theory, we can give a first representation of our birational models; then, by having a brief look at the toric case, we will describe how toric degenerations come into play in this classification.
Ultimately, we can recreate analogous constructions to the cascade of blow ups for the smooth case with the representatives of specific deformation classes of our orbifolds.</li>
