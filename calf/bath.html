Bath railway station is called &quot;Bath Spa&quot;.
</p><p>
Upon leaving the station head forwards up Manvers Street - the main bus station is on your left. The busses to the university are the numbers <a href="http://www.firstgroup.com/bustravel_results.php?&loc_name=&service=18&destination=&operator=&operator=3" target="_blank">18 and 418</a>, and leave from the stop in front of &quot;King's&quot; kebab and pizza  shop on <a href="http://www.streetmap.co.uk/newmap.srf?x=375225&amp;y=164432&amp;z=1&amp;sv=375250,164250&amp;st=4&amp;ar=Y&amp;mapp=newmap.srf&amp;searchp=newsearch.srf" target="_blank">Railway Street</a> behind the Bus Station. (For a street map of Bath <a href="http://www.bath.ac.uk/maps/cobmap.html" target="_blank">look here</a>.)
</p><p>
The university campus is located at the top of a rather steep hill, and has just one main bus terminal which is 
impossible to miss. On the <a href="http://www.bath.ac.uk/maps/campusmap.html" target="_blank">campus map</a> it is the bus stop (denoted by the little red dots) right in the centre of the campus.
</p><p>
Upon leaving the bus follow the signs to &quot;The Parade&quot;. After walking up a few steps you quickly arrive in the centre of the campus, with the library (number 1 on the <a href="http://www.bath.ac.uk/maps/campusmap.html" target="_blank">campus map</a>) on your right. The library is a distinctive modern glass building filled with computers. You are looking for 1W (1 West), which is on the right past the library (see the map).
</p><p>
When in 1W proceed up one flight of steps and follow the signs for 3.24.
</p><p>
If you intend to travel by car then detailed directions can be <a href="http://www.bath.ac.uk/getting-here/#car" target="_blank">found here</a>.
